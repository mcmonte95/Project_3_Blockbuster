## Description
This project focuses on exploring the data from Blockbuster, specifically the geographical locations of Blockbuster stores from their inception to their closure. Our goal is to create an interactive map visualization of the continental United States. This map will feature a scrollbar mechanism to display the latitude and longitude of each store throughout the years. As users scroll through time, they will observe the visualization of stores popping up during their opening years and then disappearing as they began closing, providing a dynamic view of Blockbuster's presence and decline over the years.

## Project Tasks
1. **Data Sourcing and Parsing:** Identify and procure a relevant data source for Blockbuster store locations. Extract and process the data for further use.
2. **Database Creation:** Develop a SQL database to manage and store the parsed data efficiently.
3. **API Development:** Implement a Flask API that interfaces with the SQL database, facilitating data transfer to the frontend.
4. **Frontend Development:** Design and build the frontend using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This includes developing the map visualization and the scrollbar mechanism for temporal navigation.

    ### Possible Leaflet Plugins for Mapview
    - **Leaflet.markercluster**: For managing and clustering multiple markers.
    - **Leaflet.timeline**: To add temporal controls and animate the map based on time data.
    - **Leaflet.heat**: To create heat map layers showing density/intensity of store locations.
    - **Leaflet Control Geocoder**: For adding geocoding capabilities to the map.
    - **Leaflet.draw**: Allows users to draw shapes or markers on the map for interactive features.
