## Description
This project focuses on exploring the data from Blockbuster, specifically the geographical locations of Blockbuster stores from their inception to their closure. Our goal is to create an interactive map visualization of the continental United States. This map will feature a scrollbar mechanism to display the latitude and longitude of each store throughout the years. As users scroll through time, they will observe the visualization of stores popping up during their opening years and then disappearing as they began closing, providing a dynamic view of Blockbuster's presence and decline over the years.
